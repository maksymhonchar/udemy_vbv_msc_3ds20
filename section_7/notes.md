## Why 3DS 2.0?
- It is more secured
- Most important differences between 3DS 1.0 and 3DS 2.0 standards:
    - Method: 
        - 1.0: static password, does not require an OTP
        - 2.0: 2FA (one)
    - Data:
        - 1.0: x15 data elements available
        - 2.0: enables 10x more data to be exchanged
            - 41 conditional data points are required for merchants to send to issuers, 150 additional elements
    - Use cases:
        - 1.0: only simple guest check-out
        - 2.0: guest checkout with additional use cases: provisioning, wallets, tokenization
    - Decisioning:
        - 1.0: issuer defines whether payment goes through 3DS, Merchant has no control over whether customer should go through the authentication process
        - 2.0: enhances decisioning based on merchants data
- Note: 3DS 1.0 is more suited for webpage, whereas 3DS 2.0 is suited for any kind of device
- 3DS 1.0 was more for web
